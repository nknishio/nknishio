**Hi, Iâ€™m Nelson, a junior at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley. I'm interested in pursuing scientific research in machine learning, statistics, computational biology/bioinformatics, biomedical engineering, and quantum computing.**

Below are some projects I've worked on (click on titles for details, papers, and more!):

- **[Early Detection and Severity Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Through Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://github.com/nknishio/Diabetic-Retinopathy)**
  - Novel image processing techniques for retina fundus scans
  - Severity level classification for 5 stages of diabetic retinopathy: Healthy, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferate
  - App development for real-time screening
  
- **[Magnification Independent Multi-Classification of Breast Cancer in Histopathology Images Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/nknishio/Breast-Cancer)**
  - Image processing/normalization techniques
  - Tackling breast cancer classification tasks for 8 different classes from histopathology images
    
- **[Evaluating the Effects of Color and Image Manipulation on Classification of Cervical Spondylosis X-Ray images using Deep Learning](https://github.com/nknishio/Cervical-Spondylosis)**
  - Color manipulations/image processing for spinal X-rays
  - Use of both classical CNNs and quantum CNNs (Q-CNNs) to classify cervical spondylosis
  - Comparative analysis of quantum computing vs deep learning
