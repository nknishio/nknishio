Below are some projects I've worked on _(click on titles for details, papers, and more!)_:

- 👁️ **[Early Detection and Severity Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Through Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://github.com/nknishio/Diabetic-Retinopathy)**
  - Novel image processing techniques for retina fundus scans
  - Severity level classification for 5 stages of diabetic retinopathy: Healthy, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferate
  - App development for real-time screening
  
- 💉 **[Magnification Independent Multi-Classification of Breast Cancer in Histopathology Images Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/nknishio/Breast-Cancer)**
  - Image processing/normalization techniques
